            <p>
                Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an online first-person shooter that’s had a large following and presence
                within the esport scene for many years. The game requires quick reaction times, pixel perfect aim and a huge
                map awareness where players need to make use of strategic plays and good communication within the team. This
                is probably why the game is perfectly suited for broadcasting of professional matches and tournaments and also
                managed to gather such an avid and loyal following.
            </p>
            <p>
                CS:GO was developed by Valve Corporations and Hidden Path Entertainment and was launched to the public in 2012.
                Before Global Offensive, which is the 4th game in the series, the first Counter Strike title (more commonly known
                as Counter Strike 1.6) was released back in 2000. But even before then, it was initially released as a Half Life
                Modification, created by two community members. This modification quickly gained popularity and traction, which
                led to Valve hiring the creators, in no time, the game’s intellectual property was acquired and the development
                of the series began. The rest is history!
            </p>
            <h3>Game Modes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deathmatch</strong></br>
                    <p>
                        The forever returning deathmatch. Team deathmatch has been a staple in first-person
                        shooter games since the likes of Doom and Quake. The game mode pits two different teams against each other with
                        a set amount of kills to reach to be the victor, and it’s no different in CS:GO. Pick your weapon, score some
                        kills, and on death you are respawned somewhere else on the map.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Arms Race</strong></br>
                    <p>
                        In Arms Race, there are no teams. It’s you against everyone else and you are not allowed to pick your own
                        weapon. On spawn, a weapon is assigned to you, and to accumulate new weapons, you have to get a kill with the weapon
                        you’re given. This continues until you have cycled through all the weapons and finally you will be given a knife. Humiliate
                        your opponents and get a kill with it, and the win is yours! This is a very casual and relaxed mode, and it’s great
                        for warming up or for having some fun with your friends.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Demolition</strong></br>
                    <p>
                        This is the game mode that is used when playing in competitive matches. Here the counter-terrorist and terrorist
                        are given objectives of either defusing or planting a bomb. Teams are 5v5 and there’s no respawn on death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you get killed, you have to wait until the end of the current round. If you get kills in this mode, you will be rewarded with
                        new weapons and accessories such as grenades. The goal for the terrorists is to plant the bomb and if they succeed with
                        this, the counter-terrorists not only have to kill all enemies to win, but also have to make sure that the bomb is defused
                        before it goes off. This goes on for 10 rounds, until the teams switch sides and the first team to win 11 rounds will be
                        victorious.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Casual</strong></br>
                    <p>
                        In this game mode the matches can be up to 10v10 and it’s up to the team playing counter-terrorist to either defuse
                        the bomb if planted, or rescue hostages. This game mode is limited to a maximum of 15 rounds, and the first team to
                        win 8 rounds will win the match. In Casual you earn money each round that you are able to spend on equipment and weapons
                        in the beginning of next round. This game mode is also using the matchmaking system, this means that players will be matched
                        with equally skilled players according to their rank, but you are still able to invite friends to the game with either a
                        lower or higher skill rating than yourself.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Competitive</strong></br>
                    <p>
                        The competitive mode is where the real action happens. You will not be able to join this game mode until you’ve reached a
                        certain level of experience, which you can reach by playing the other modes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This mode also has another ranking system, that differs from the account experience you otherwise get by playing. You have
                        18 different ranks to fight for, with the most prestigious one being Global Elite. Today there’s less than 1% of the player
                        base that are currently ranked as Global Elite, so reaching this rank surely is an achievement to be proud of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game mode itself is very similar to Demolition mentioned above, but the difference is that you gather money in each
                        round by getting kills or going for the objectives. This money can then be used at the start of each round to buy weapons
                        and equipment. Just like demolition you play 5v5, and there are no respawns here as well. A match can be as long as 90 minutes,
                        and if you leave before the game is finished, your account will get a timeout penalty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you’ve leveled up to the first couple of ranks in this mode, your skills as a player will surely be tested. This game mode
                        requires a lot of map knowledge and good communication skills. You can use matchmaking for this mode. However, if you’ve started
                        to climb the ranks, a pre-made group of friends or with players from your clan gives you the added advantage. This, coupled with
                        good teamwork and knowledge of each others’ playing styles will definitely allow you to advance in the game further.
