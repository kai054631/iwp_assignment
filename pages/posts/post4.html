        <p>
            In Dota 2, two teams of five players are matched against each other on a map with two different 
            bases that need to be occupied or defended. Before every match each player gets to choose a powerful 
            character from a big roster of 115 different “Heroes”, all with different abilities, strengths and weaknesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the game, players collect experience points to level up their characters by performing different 
            feats, such as killing another hero or progressing closer towards the enemy base by killing defense towers. 
            According to their performance, players can collect and earn gold. This is a very vital part of the game as 
            earning gold will allow you to buy items for your character that can vastly improve your characters’ 
            effectiveness. The first team to destroy the opposing team’s base will be crowned winners.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How To Play Dota 2 ? </h3>
        <p>
            The main goal of Dota 2 is to destroy the enemy’s ancient building, which is the biggest building inside of your 
            team’s base, and by doing this you’ll win the game. The two different teams need to pick one individual hero to 
            play during the entire match. It’s important for players to pick a character you are willing to stick to, because 
            once you’ve picked your hero there’s no turning back until the next game.</br>
            The map has 3 different lanes (left, mid and right) that leads from one team’s base to the other. Players then 
            decide with their teammates which of their lanes will be your focus at the start of the game. In these lanes, players 
            will run into defense towers and non-player characters (creeps) which need to be killed to gather experience points and 
            gold.</br>
            By killing these creeps and destroying defense towers, you’ll help your team to progress closer to the enemy base. 
            As a player focusing on a lane, as is the enemy team, this is where the player versus player action begins.</br>
            All heroes are very weak at the beginning of each game, hence the importance of gathering experience and gold. The 
            experience points are used to level up your character and when leveling up you can acquire new abilities or upgrade     
            the ones you already have. With gold, you can buy items that can give you a higher damage power, quicker run speed 
            or similar and the more expensive items can even grant you extra abilities that can help you turn the battlefield 
            into your favour.</br>
            However, to gather gold from the creeps, you need to be the player that does the killing blow. If you don’t get the 
            killing blow, no gold will be awarded. You can also deny your enemies their killing blows on your own creeps by making 
            sure that you kill them yourself, just before the enemy hero is lining up a killing blow. This is an amazing way of denying 
            your enemy gold, but also experience as only 70% of the creeps regular experience will be rewarded to your enemies, and the 
            remaining 30% will be rewarded to your team.</br>
            So, early in game, focusing on getting last hits on creeps and denying your enemies to farm gold and experience is a great 
            way of gaining a huge advantage in the game. This is due to heroes being weak in the early game, and if one of the team manages
            to get one or two levels above their opponents it’s very easy to continue to slay them as your willpower increases at a higher 
            rate than your enemies. </br>
            This is often referred to as “snowballing”, since you are taking advantage of being the more powerful hero and utilizing this 
            momentum to keep growing stronger. One good way for the enemy team to hinder a snowballing hero is to put a lot of effort in 
            making sure that the hero gets killed. By killing a hero with a strong gold grind or a hero that’s on a kill streak, the rewards 
            are higher than normal which gives the team a small opportunity to catch up and even out the odds. </br>
            If you, as a player are unfortunate enough to end up in a lane where the enemy hero is starting to snowball, you could be the 
            one that enables him to do this. This is called “feeding” and is one of the worst things you can do in the game. </br>
            If you notice that you have begun to “feed” the enemy hero by allowing him to continuously kill you, you need to make some 
            changes to your play style and either ask for help from your teammates to rush your lane and help you end the enemies’ killing 
            spree, or you simply need to make sure to not engage in fights you don’t believe you can win. Sometimes running away can be a 
            much better strategy than to pick fights you’re not comfortable in.</br>
            After this early stage of the game it’s time for “Mid game”. This is when the team try to make efforts to push their lanes and
            get rid of as many defense towers as possible. It’s also pretty common that players start to try “ganking” enemy heroes by leaving 
            their lanes and try their best to flank the enemy heroes by coming up behind them and attack them together at the same time to get 
            quick kills. </br>
            This is a great way to get some more map control and push further into your lanes. But be careful, if you leave your lane to gank 
            another, you are leaving your own lane without proper defence, and the enemy could also use this as a counter to push your lane 
            closer to your base. </br>
